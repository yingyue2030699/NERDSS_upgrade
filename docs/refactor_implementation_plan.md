# NERDSS Upgrade Implementation Plan

This plan splits the upgrade into assignable workstreams for dedicated agents.
The central rule is that core simulation behavior must remain unchanged unless a
separate, reviewed scientific change request explicitly approves it. Refactors,
format changes, diagnostics, and performance work must be validated against
baseline outputs before they land.

## Repository Observations

- Core engine is C++ with `src/` split by domain and public headers under
  `include/`.
- Current build entry points are `Makefile` and `CMakeLists.txt`; the Makefile
  supports `serial`, `mpi`, `debug`, and `profile`.
- Existing validation assets live mainly under `sample_inputs/VALIDATE_SUITE`
  and `run_code_tests`.
- Current outputs are mostly ad hoc `.dat`, `.xyz`, `.psf`, restart, and text
  files, with some JSON already present through `write_bonded_complex_json.cpp`
  and bundled `nlohmann_json`.
- Error handling currently mixes custom exception classes, direct `exit(...)`,
  and formatted `std::cerr` messages.
- Generated Doxygen HTML is committed under `docs/html`; future documentation
  should distinguish source docs from generated artifacts.

## Global Working Rules

1. Preserve behavior first. Every refactor branch starts by recording a baseline
   for at least one deterministic or fixed-seed example that exercises the code
   being touched.
2. Refactor in vertical slices. Prefer small, reviewable changes that keep the
   executable runnable over large rewrites.
3. Keep old input and output formats readable/writable until a documented
   deprecation window exists.
4. Separate mechanics from science. Formatting, naming, ownership, and data
   structure changes must not modify reaction probabilities, RNG streams,
   propagation, boundary behavior, or MPI partitioning unless explicitly scoped.
5. Each agent updates this document or a linked log under `docs/upgrade/` with
   decisions, validation runs, benchmarks, and unresolved risks.

## Phase 0: Baseline And Work Coordination

### Agent A: Repository Baseline And Branch Policy

Scope:
- Create a stable branch naming scheme, for example `codex/upgrade-*`.
- Record compiler, GSL, CMake, Make, OS, and optional MPI versions.
- Decide whether C++11 remains required or whether the project can move to
  C++14/C++17. The current CMake file uses C++11 while README badges mention
  C++ >=14, so this must be resolved before broad modernization.
- Add `docs/upgrade/decision_log.md` and `docs/upgrade/validation_log.md`.

Deliverables:
- Documented development environment matrix.
- Branch and PR template guidance.
- Decision on supported C++ standard.

Acceptance criteria:
- A new contributor can build the current serial executable from the docs.
- The team agrees on the minimum compiler and language standard.

Dependencies:
- None.

### Agent B: Baseline Build And Smoke Runner

Scope:
- Verify `make serial`, `make mpi` when MPI is available, and CMake serial build.
- Add a small script, for example `tools/run_smoke_tests.py`, that builds and
  runs a short sample input in an isolated temporary directory.
- Capture stdout, stderr, exit code, produced files, and runtime.

Deliverables:
- Repeatable smoke command for local and CI use.
- First baseline artifact bundle for selected samples.

Acceptance criteria:

  with small systems such as `homoTrimer`, `hetTrimer`, `create_destroy`,
  `michaelis_menten`, `implicit_lipid`, and `sphere`.
- Standardize fixed seed invocation through the existing command parser.
- Define file-level comparisons for deterministic outputs and tolerant numeric
  comparisons for floating-point text outputs.
- Include restart validation, because `sample_inputs/VALIDATE_SUITE/README`
  explicitly requires checking both fresh starts and restart paths.

Deliverables:
- `tests/regression/` harness.
- Baseline manifests with file names, comparison mode, tolerances, and ignored
  volatile lines.
- Clear pass/fail report.

Acceptance criteria:
- The harness can compare current `master` against itself and pass.
- At least one fresh-run and one restart-run case are covered.

- Agent B smoke runner.

### Agent D: Stochastic Coherence Validation

Scope:
- Define statistical checks for stochastic examples: means, ranges,
  distribution summaries, event counts, and monotonic invariants.
- Identify which outputs are scientifically meaningful for stochastic
  comparison and which are implementation artifacts.
- Run small ensembles at fixed seed sets to establish expected envelopes.

Deliverables:
- Stochastic validation spec.

  until the Google Test harness is in place.
- Re-spin useful existing CTest-era assertions as Google Test cases only after
  the harness, dependency bootstrap, and CI command model are approved.

  anchored to regression or validation examples.

Deliverables:
- `tests/unit/` structure.
- `tests/integration/` structure for slower pipeline and validation examples.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Agents A, B, and C start first. No broad refactor should proceed until build,
   smoke, and deterministic validation exist.
2. Agents E and F add style/static/sanitizer guardrails once the build path is
   stable.
3. Agents G and O/P map architecture and performance hotspots in parallel.
4. Agents H, I, M, and N handle orchestration, parser, and diagnostics because
   they reduce risk for later work.
5. Agents K and L modernize input and output formats behind compatibility flags.
6. Agent J performs computationally adjacent refactors in small slices, guided
   by the profiler and guarded by regression tests.
7. Agents Q and R make the checks standard in local development and GitHub
   Actions.
8. Agents S and T continuously update user/developer documentation.

- Were stochastic outputs coherent under the documented envelope?
- Did runtime or memory change on the relevant benchmark?
- Were legacy inputs and outputs preserved?
- Are new errors cleaner than the old failure mode?
